I want to build an app that can measure green space in any city around the world. Ideally the app should also be able to show changes in green space over the years going back 10 or 20 years. The app can be built on any platform/language. The app should score the inputted city on a scale of 1-100. The app should show percentage of greenspace change over each year. Any greenspace in the city counts - yards, backyards, parks, forests, swamps, etc. Pretty much anything that appears green on the map. We can use external API like API from Google or SENTINEL HUB or other places where we might be able to get this data from. Suggestions for new sources of green space information are welcome. Ask me 10 questions about this app before building anything. 

I can see you already have SENTINEL HUB API credentials set up, which is great for satellite imagery analysis! This is an exciting project that could provide valuable insights into urban environmental changes.

Before I start building, I'd like to ask you 10 questions to ensure I create exactly what you need:

## Technical & Platform Questions

1. **Platform Preference**: Would you prefer a web application, mobile app, or desktop application? Or should it be responsive and work across all platforms?

2. **User Interface**: Do you envision this as a simple search-based tool where users input a city name, or would you like an interactive map where users can click/select areas? Should it have data visualization charts for the historical trends?

3. **Geographic Boundaries**: How should the app define "city" boundaries? Should it use:
   - Official municipal boundaries
   - Metropolitan statistical areas
   - User-defined radius from city center
   - Administrative boundaries from OpenStreetMap

## Data & Accuracy Questions

4. **Data Sources**: Besides SENTINEL HUB (which you have set up), would you like me to integrate multiple data sources for better accuracy? Options include:
   - Google Earth Engine
   - NASA Landsat
   - MODIS vegetation indices
   - Local government open data APIs

5. **Analysis Resolution**: What level of detail do you want?
   - Pixel-level analysis (very detailed but slower)
   - Grid-based analysis (faster, good enough for city-level)
   - Predefined zones/districts

6. **Green Space Classification**: Should the app distinguish between different types of green space (parks vs forests vs agricultural land) or treat them all equally? This affects both scoring and user understanding.

## Scoring & Analytics Questions

7. **Scoring Algorithm**: For the 1-100 scale, what should influence the score?
   - Total percentage of green space only
   - Green space per capita
   - Distribution/accessibility of green space
   - Quality/density of vegetation
   - Comparison to similar-sized cities

8. **Historical Data**: What's most important for the historical analysis?
   - Absolute change (hectares gained/lost)
   - Percentage change relative to total city area
   - Trend analysis (steady growth/decline vs sudden changes)
   - Seasonal adjustment (to account for natural vegetation cycles)

## Performance & Scale Questions

9. **Response Time**: Should the analysis be:
   - Real-time (user waits 10-30 seconds for fresh analysis)
   - Pre-computed for major cities (instant results)
   - Hybrid approach (cached for popular cities, computed for others)

10. **Target Scale**: Are you planning for:
    - Personal/research use (hundreds of queries)
    - Public tool (thousands of users)
    - Commercial application (needs robust infrastructure)


1. web app 3. simple search where use inputs city name 3. openstreetmap boundaries 4. any option that can be used worldwide - Google sounds good 5. grid base 6. no, treat all greenspace as one category 7. total percentage of greenspace only 8. trend analysis 9. pre-computed list of cities defined in @cities.json 10. personal/research for now.

Let me know if you need Google Places API key, then I will place it in .env file


redeploy the app based on these notes from my very smart friend. Ask me 10 questions before proceeding:

    Looking at these comprehensive notes for a sophisticated Green Space Data Pipeline, I need to understand your specific requirements and constraints before redeploying the app. This is a very complex system involving satellite imagery processing, machine learning models, and large-scale geospatial analysis.

Here are my 10 questions:

## Technical Scope & Implementation

1. **Pipeline Scope**: Do you want to implement the complete 6-step pipeline (preprocessing → validation), or are you looking to focus on specific components? Which steps are highest priority?

2. **Data Access**: What satellite data sources do you currently have access to? Do you have API keys/subscriptions for Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, SRTM, WorldView, and PlanetScope imagery?

3. **ML Infrastructure**: Do you have access to GPU resources for model training and inference? Are you planning to use cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure) or local infrastructure?

## Architecture & Deployment

4. **Deployment Target**: Where do you want to deploy this? (Local development, cloud platforms, edge computing, etc.) What's your preferred hosting solution?

5. **Data Scale**: What geographic area/scale are you targeting initially? (City-level, country-level, global?) This affects storage and processing requirements.

6. **Existing Functionality**: Looking at your current app, what parts should be preserved? Should the new pipeline integrate with the existing UI components?

## Resources & Timeline

7. **Budget/Resources**: What's your budget for cloud computing, data storage, and API access? This pipeline could be very resource-intensive.

8. **Pre-trained Models**: Do you have access to the trained U-Net model mentioned, or do we need to implement training from scratch?

## User Experience & Features

9. **Primary Use Case**: Who will be using this system? Researchers, city planners, general public? What's the main user journey you envision?

10. **Real-time vs Batch**: Do you need real-time analysis capabilities, or is batch processing of historical data sufficient for your use case?

These answers will help me determine whether to build a full enterprise-grade pipeline, a simplified proof-of-concept, or something in between that matches your actual needs and resources.

1. let's focus on step 1 and step 6 - we don't necessarily need all the steps - whatever is simpler and easier to implement to start would be best. 2. @.env has API keys for sentinel and Google Earth Engine 3. no 4. local now 5. city level 6. let's keep the UI, everything else can be discarded if needed 7. very low budget 8. no access to pre-trained models. I want simplest implementation possible. I want the app to look at the map and see where the vegetation is and then show that on the map and also show the percentage of green vegetation on the map as well visually in the purple colour with darker purple for more vegetation and translucent purple for less vegetation. 9. city planners 10. Let's do real time to start one city at a time during the testing phase.


Calculate other vegetation index when calculating green space. 
	⁃	EVI = 2.5 (B8 - B4) / (B5 + 6 B4 - 7.5 B2 + 1)
	⁃	GNDVI = (B8 - B3 + B4) / (B8 + B3 + B4)
	⁃	BSI = (B2 + B4 - B3) / (B2 + B4 + B3)
	⁃	MSAVI2 = (2 B8 + 1 - sqrt((2 B8 + 1)^2 - 8(B8 - B4)^2)) / 2
